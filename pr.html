<h2>Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore</h2>
  <p>In June of 2021, I drove 12 hours north to Michigan's upper peninsula to Pictured Rocks
  National Lakeshore. The friends I went with and I tent camped right on the shore of Lake Superior.
The sunsets were gorgeous and staying outdoors right on the lake is an experience unlike any other.
While there, we went on an 11 mile hike, canoed 8 miles around an island in the lake, suntanned on the shore,
ate countless s'mores, and made irreplaceable memories.
