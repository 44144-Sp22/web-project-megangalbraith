  <h3> About me </h3>
  <p>My name is Megan, I'm a 19 year old Digital Media student at NWMSU with a
    wanderer's heart and a dream to see, well, everything! My favorite days of
    my year are the ones I'm not at home, and while I love my home and everyone
    there, my heart is happiest on the road. Right now my list of visited destinations
    is small, but I am already in the works to make it grow. This website will
    show some places I have been and the experiences I had, as well as my upcoming
    trip and why I am just so excited to go!</p>
