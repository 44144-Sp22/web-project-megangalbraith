<h2>Coming soon...Alaska!</h2>
  <p>I will be spending Summer 2022 in Alaska on a commercial salmon boat. For many years
    my older brother has spent his summers in Alaska with a crew fishing salmon. This year I
    am joining the crew to keep books and help out on the boat. I am so excited to experience this wonderful State
    for an entire summer!
